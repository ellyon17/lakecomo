# Game Introduction Text (from Script)
GAME_INTRODUCTION = """
Welcome to Murder Mystery on Lake Como

The morning air is crisp as your car pulls up to the gates of the stunning Villa Patrizi on the shores of Lake Como. It's 6:00 AM on April 15th. You are Detective [Player Name], one of Milan's most renowned investigators, known for untangling the most complex cases.

An urgent call summoned you here. The villa's owner, Cristiano Patrizi, a powerful and self-made industrialist, was found dead in his private study just hours ago, around 4:00 AM, by the distraught butler, Antonello Pisani.

Yesterday, April 14th, was Cristiano's 50th birthday, and the villa hosted a lavish celebration. What began as a grand affair simmered down to an intimate gathering of close friends, family, and associates staying at the villa.

Now, the laughter has died, replaced by suspicion and fear. The serene beauty of Lake Como hides a dark secret. Everyone who remained at the villa is now confined to the grounds. They are all suspects, and no one leaves until you uncover the truth.
